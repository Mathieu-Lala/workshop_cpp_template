## Introduction

This workshop will help you to learn templates and metaprogramming from scratch : don't panic if you never used them before.
Take a look on the definition of ['template metaprogramming'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_metaprogramming)

**Warning : C++ meta-programming is not modern C++**  (and it trend to be deprecated), but it is a very interesting topic !

## What you will do

**Click to that [link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/QuantStack/xeus-cling/stable?filepath=notebooks/xcpp.ipynb) and upload the `Workshop.ipynb`**

Each one contain exercises, meant to work around all the knownledge of the template in C++.
Resolve all the exercice one by one !

To check if you have succeded, make sure that you have the expected output of our main.
